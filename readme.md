# `canvasInteractor`

## What is it ... ?

`canvasInteractor` is a micro-library (9.1 kB uncompressed) used to handle pointer events together with one or more HTML canvases.
It implements a global event loop based on `requestAnimationFrame` and supports throttling of `pointermove` and `wheel` events via its custom `tick` event. Cartesian coordinates with user defined origin are possible.
It is used by my students for web-kinematics projects.

`canvas-area` is a lightweight custom html element as a controller parent for one or more canvas elements.
It allows *zoom*, *pan* and *resize* interactions.

## Where is the markup code ...

```html
<canvas-area id="ca" width="401" height="301" resizable="both">
    <canvas id="c"></canvas>
</canvas-area>
```

### Attributes

* `width`: width of element in `px`.
* `height`: height of element in `px`.
* `resizable`: one of [`'none'`, `'horizontal'`, `'vertical'`, `'both'`].
* `cartesian`: `true` or `false`

## Multiple Canvases

Multiple canvases are mostly used as layers in practice. It is up to you, how you organize, what to draw on which layer. Often there is a *background* layer holding static graphics, which does not need to be updated frequently. In contrast to that there might be a *dynamic* layer holding animated graphics for instance. There also might be an *interactivity* layer, containing editable geometry.

Separating low frequently updated geometry from high frequently updated geometry by different layers should result in a performance gain.

Please note, when using multiple canvases - and stacking them on top of each other:

* For every canvas element, perhaps except the first one, use `position:absolute;` style.
* Stacking level can be made explicite using `z-index: 5;`  style.
* `canvas` elements are transparent by default. So avoid giving them background colors.
* `canvas-area` is managing the *resize*  of its `canvas` children, but not their `redraw`.
*  `canvas-area` is managing the *view* parameters for *pan* and *zoom*, but does not apply those values to the `canvas` contexes. Do that by yourself while redrawing or using the `on('view',...)` handler.

Example:
```html
<canvas-area id="ca" width="401" height="301">
    <canvas id="c1" style="position:absolute; z-index:1;"></canvas>
    <canvas id="c2" style="position:absolute; z-index:2;"></canvas>
</canvas-area>
```

## Show me the scripting API ...

`canvas-area` behaves as a standard html container element with known inherited DOM properties and methods. Additionally it offers properties ...

| Property | Type | Value | Default |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|
|`width`|Number| width of element in `px`| `300 px` |
|`height`|Number| height of element in `px`| `150 px` |
|`resizable`|String| one of [`'none'`, `'horizontal'`, `'vertical'`, `'both'`]| `'none'`|
|`cursor`|String| simple interface to CSS cursor attribute. | `'auto'` |
|`view`|`{x,y,scl}`| origin location `x,y` in `px` and scaling factor `scl` | `{0,0,1}` |
|`cartesian`|Boolean| `true`: `y`-axis pointing up, <br>`false`: `y`-axis pointing down  | `false` |
|`observable`|Object| initially (lazily) set external observable object once.  | - |

... methods ...

| Method | Arguments | Returns |Comment |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|`pan({dx,dy})`|`dx`: delta x<br>`dy`: delta y | `undefined`| origin displacement. Modifies `view` property |
|`zoom({x,y,scl})`|`x`: x-center<br>`y`: y-center<br>`scl`: factor | `undefined`| zoom about point `{x,y}` by factor `scl`. Modifies  `view` property  |
|`pntToUsr({x,y})`| point | point | transform argument point (device coordinates) to result point (user coordinates) with respect to `view` property  |
|`notify(key,value)`|`key`:&nbsp;event&nbsp;type<br>`value`:&nbsp;event&nbsp;data |`undefined`| notify observers of event type `key` about event `value`|
|`on(key,handler)`|`key`:&nbsp;event&nbsp;type<br>`handler`:&nbsp;event&nbsp;handler|`this`| register `handler` with event type `key`. |

... and events, which can be observed via `observe` method.


| Type | Object | Value |
|:---|:---:|:---|
|`'pointer'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| User has moved the pointer. |
|`'drag'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| User has moved the pointer with left button down. |
|`'resize'`|`{width,height}`| User did resize `canvas-area` element |
|`'view'`|`{x,y,scl}`| User modified the `view` property via *pan*, *zoom*, ... |
|`'buttondown'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| User has pressed the pointer device's button down. |
|`'buttonup'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| User has released the pointer device's button. |
|`'pointerenter'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| pointer has entered the `canvas-area`. |
|`'pointerleave'`|`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup>| pointer has left the `canvas-area`. |

`{x,y,...}`<sup>*</sup> custom event data object: 


| Property | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`x,y`| Pointer location in device coordinates. |
|`dx,dy`| Pointer displacement in device coordinates since last pointer event. |
|`buttons`| Device buttons pressed (`1`:left, `2`: right, `4`: middle button). |
|`delta`| Mouse wheel delta units. |

## FAQ

* __Does not work properly with Mobile Device X and Touch Screen Y ?__
  * Desktop browsers only are addressed primarily at current.
  * Implementation of touch events is experimental (*pan* works with touch and *resize* also using a *pen* now).
  * Issues with Microsoft Edge.

* __Can you implement feature X and possibly feature Y ?__
  * `canvas-area` serves my personal needs very well as it is.
  * So ... no, I won't.
  * Please go ahead and implement it by yourself.
  * If you think, your enhancement is of common interest, you are very welcome, to send me a pull request.

## Changelog

###  [0.4.7] on January 28, 2018
* `observable` setter (only) for possibly injecting an external observable object. So enable delegating observer management to 'app' object.

###  [0.4.5] on January 19, 2018
* chainable method `on(key,handler)` added.
* method `observe(key,handler)` marked as deprecated. Use `on(key,handler)` instead.
* renamed event property `buttons` to `btn` in [`drag`,`pointer`,`buttondown`,`buttonup`,`pointerenter`,`pointerleave`] event.
* necessary styles `display: block; overflow: hidden;` automatically added as inline style while constructing.
* touch events experimentally implemented.

###  [0.4.0] on January 06, 2018
* Initial release.
